And we're talking to people about their thoughts on the apocalypse. So I'd love to ask you, has there been a moment in your life where you felt like the world was ending in some sort of way? I don't think so. Maybe I'm a bit scared of the future, what it will be with AI. And just whole thing, what... Yeah, the future. What are your fears about AI?

Do you have any sort of personal transformation that you've experienced after a moment that you thought was really hard where you felt like maybe the world was ending or you went through a really hard time in your life, but experience a personal transformation after that? Yeah, I guess all this personal stuff when something happened with friendships or relationships and after that you feel like I don't want to live anymore, but... Did you have a specific moment? Yeah. Like any specific experience? Like I think... Yeah, one time I had a deep eating disorder, I must have stroke of two. And a hard time at home because there were a lot of... Yeah.
