 Great. We are recording. Look at Alice. Yeah. All right. I'm Namiura and I'm here today with Chifale and Aoi, who are both seniors at Harvard. What do you vote for? Hi. I study applied math. Okay. I study biology. Great. And where are you both from? I'm from Phoenix, Arizona. I'm from Japan, Tokyo. Okay. Awesome. And we are taking a class this semester on the end of the world, the apocalypse. So we're asking people in Harvard Gard, Harvard students and non-Hurbsons alike about their thoughts in the end of the world. And first question I want to ask you about separately is, have you ever had a moment in life where you felt like the world was ending? Yes. When the Mayans predicted that the world was going to end, I think 2012 or something. Yeah. I was like, what, nine? And I was like panicking. And I was like watching the news with my grandparents. And like, my grandparents like, did not believe it in the first place. But I was tweaking the entire afternoon. Okay. And then I took a nap like out of stress and I woke up and the world was still there. Those are the same with Justin Bieber who said this too and his hit song, Beauty and a Beat. It was, we're going to party until unless like it's 2012 tonight. Yeah. Right? Yes. Okay. 2012. How about you, Aoi? Um, I can't see you better. You've never felt like the world was ending. And like this could be global, it could be personal. I mean, I think when I saw this kind of like a really weird color, I was like, oh, like the world might be ending. But that was like not serious. Did you feel scared or anxious at all? Oh, it all. When was this? Like, six years ago. Okay. Yeah. Did you tell anyone about it? I think I was with my friends. Okay. Yeah. You were like, oh, like, wow. Like, that's crazy color. Okay. Okay. I think I would feel the same way if I saw this guy with the crazy color. All right. Um, next question I have for you is, uh, is, if you could put a date on the end of the world or a general time, like some number of years, what would you, what would you say? Hopefully not within our lifetime. Okay. But like, it could be. So realistically, if you could approximate, what would you think it would be? I think because of like a climate disaster, like maybe in the next like 30 to 40 years. 30 to 40 years. Okay. I don't know if you have any. But in the 40 years of the world, we'll end. Like hopefully not. Hopefully not. But like, I could see. Uh, I don't think the world will end. Would you? Would you? You don't think it will end here yet? No, I don't think so. So you don't think the world will ever end? No. Okay. Okay. That's the first thing we've got. I think the first. Optimist over here. No, this is great. We have very opposite thoughts. We've also never heard that in interview. I think everyone has had. We do. Yeah. No, I think it'll just keep going like, we got. Okay. That's so interesting. I need a question. Yes. I think that's everything. Great. Thank you. Thank you.
