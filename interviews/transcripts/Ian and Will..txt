 I mean, a fast record. Alright, hi. I'm Namiara. What are your names? I'm Ian. Ian and... I will. Well, thanks to meet you both. So I'm Namiara. This is Alice. We're in a class right now called Stories from the End of the World. And we're talking people about the apocalypse. My question to you is, have you ever found like the world is ending? And what? I mean, I think people throughout all time, like throughout all history have always said the world is ending. There's like always scares. People like to predict dates and everything and then they're just made fools of when it doesn't happen. So I think that's maybe not quite the right outlook to have in life. Because if you're always worried about the world ending, are you really going to be able to do anything good for the world? That's my personal opinion. Sure. How about you, Ian? Yeah. Has there ever been a moment when you thought the world is ending? Could be personal, could be global, could be communal? No, because world's going to end when Jesus comes back and that's going to be like lightning flashing the sky, won't be able to predict it. So yeah, I don't know. Kind of like what Will said. You're not going to be able to be like, oh, it's like right now. So yeah, I don't want to look like that. All right. We love and enjoy. Great. Thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.
