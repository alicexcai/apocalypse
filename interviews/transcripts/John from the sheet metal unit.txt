 Perfect. Hi, so I'm Numeria and nice to meet you. This is Alice. We're in a class this semester called Stories from the End of the World. It's on the apocalypse. What's your name? John. John, nice to meet you. John, what do you do? I am in the sheet metal union. In the sheet metal union? Yeah. So what is on the construction? Okay construction, cool. And how long have you been doing that? Seven years. Okay, super. Really interesting. We both worked with some sheet metal in our lives, but probably not to the same extent. Our question basically is that we are seeing that there are a lot of apocalypsees around the world that people experience, whether they're personal or communal or global. Could you tell us about a time when you felt like the world was ending and how you might have or not seen some sort of personal transformation come from this? I don't know. I don't think I've seen it with a day since when you felt like the world was ending. Could be a personal experience. I never felt like the world was ending. Never. It's always good. Wow. Okay. Next question is when do you think the apocalypse is coming? Hopefully never. Hopefully never. I hope never. Great. I mean it has to happen someday, but hopefully it will be long gone. Could you approximate when you might think it is? I just say maybe a thousand years. A thousand years. Hopefully more than that. Okay great. Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it.
