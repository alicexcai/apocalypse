 Good, that was okay. Hi, I'm here with Andrew today and I'm Namiara and we're going to ask Andrew a couple of questions about the end of the world. First of all, we often talk about the apocalypse and transformation or sort of rebirth that comes out out of it. Have you ever experienced a moment in time where you felt like the world was ending? I'd say when the COVID pandemic just started, it was like kind of a shock. I was actually on spring break. I was volunteering on my mom's school, like just two new kids and I got an email from my school being like, yeah next week, we're supposed to start school again but we're going to postpone school another week. And so I was like, well, what's going on? You shake the news, everyone's like sort of freaking out. Like, oh my gosh, there's been like one new case in Toronto, things like that and you go to the grocery store and you know, there's no toilet paper anywhere. There's no like cancer in the tides. They're like all these such things are just gone. Like people are stalking their cars. So I was kind of scary. I mean, it was like, it felt like like the world around was crumbling. Nobody really knew what was happening. It was like sort of like uncertainty. So that kind of felt like the end of the world. Right. Did you experience any sort of transformation following the COVID-19 pandemic? I think so. I mean, I think it developed pretty unique characteristics in a lot of people. For me, I like learned what I enjoyed doing. I think the start of high school was like, you know, I swear with my life to doing whatever I felt like I was told. But once COVID happened, I felt like a sort of new sense of autonomy. I got to do things I enjoyed doing, things I had fun doing. Like, you know, I picked up new sports, learn new skills, read new books, things like that. So I feel like I came out of it with like completely different reasons. Great. Okay. And we have one last question. If you were to put a date on the apocalypse, what would that date be? I gotta say, it's going to be the year 3000. The year 3000. Great. Thank you so much. Thanks so much Andrew. All right.
