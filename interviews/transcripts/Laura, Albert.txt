 Hi, nice to meet you both. I'm Numeria, this is Alice. We're taking a class this semester called Stories from the End of the World. And what are your names? Alvaret, Laura. Laura, nice to meet you both. And where are you from? Barcelona. Barcelona, so you're visiting Harvard right now. Okay, well welcome to Harvard. Glad to have you here. Thank you. And we're just wondering, have you ever experienced a time when you felt like the world felt like you was ending? No, I'm not really. Not like in a physical way, but sometimes when you're thinking and you have a very complicated problem or work or family, it seems like it's going to end. But at the end of the day, you find the solution or you see that the sun is rising every day, so it's just metaphorically. Do you have any specific moment where you felt, oh my gosh, the world is ending, it's the end? No, not really actually. Okay, no. Okay, we often talk as well about transformation after apocalypse, so oftentimes after there's a really big change, or an apocalypse that feels like the world is going to end, there's this sort of rebirth or transformation, whether that's personal or communal or global. An example could be the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, where a lot of people in the world was ending or the climate crisis or the political climate. Have you experienced anything like that before? I've not experienced, but when we think, for example, we are a couple and when we are having a spring, sometimes we think, how are we going to bring more people into this world? Because we don't know how it's going to end, how the climate change or another pandemic could affect the future generations. So it's not something that we have experienced, but something that we think that maybe could happen and that it's there. So no, I don't know if we would do it. Yeah, let's talk about that. Okay, great. And then last question is, if you could put a date on when you think the apocalypse is going to be, when would that be? Like a real date? But every like. Okay. I don't know if it's going to happen or not, but maybe, I don't know, in 20 years? In 20 years? Okay. And how about you? Earlier. Earlier? Maybe seven, eight years. Seven years. Yeah, depending on how things are evolving. That's it. Next year is going to be key, I think. Okay. How they will respond to everything that's going on. Yeah, the political climate. Political climate, yeah. Political climate. Yeah. How the political crisis fall in the place now? I think it's going to be the key of how the future develops. Okay, great. Thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it.
