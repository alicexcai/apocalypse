 Start recording. Are we good? Great. Hi, I'm Nemira. What are your names? Matthew. Matthew and Lily. Nice to meet you both. I'm here with my friend and class, my Alice, and we're taking a class this semester on stories in the end of the world, with the apocalypse. We have a lot of discussions in class about this, but we just are here to ask you a couple of questions about your thoughts on the apocalypse. But first, we'd love to ask you a bit about yourselves. So what brings you to Harvard Yard? Oh, I'm actually visiting him. Okay. I'm visiting my sister. I'm visiting your sister. And your sister is a student. She's a Boston University. I've been to Boston University. So what brings you to Harvard Yard? Her. Yeah, I live in Maine and he was in Maryland, so we don't see each other a lot. Okay. And she walks into the show off. She likes Harvard. She likes Harvard. Okay, what do you like about Harvard? I've told you before, it's a very nice campus. It's, I love Boston. Okay. I think, I mean, academically rigorous. Yes. That's true. But how old are you, Bo? I'm 17. So you're in high school, so. So you're still thinking about college and what that looks like. Okay, great. Well, we're both seniors and college, so happy to chat with you about Harvard afterwards as well and any questions that you have. Do you know what you want to do after college or just in life, any thoughts? I'll maybe be into STEM fields. Okay, STEM fields. We're both in STEM fields. We do some engineering, so we can chat with you about that. What? Yeah, of course. Of course. And then Matthew, how about you? You have three pet pigs and five chickens. You're figuring it out. You're figuring it out. Okay, well, you have time. You know, I want to have a farm. Oh, you want three pet pigs and three chickens. Five chickens. Five chickens. Okay, that's a great aspiration. We have, yeah, high hopes over here. Both of us. That's awesome. Yeah, these are, these are, but I think it's really hard to have a farm. But anyways, one question that we want to ask is, is, have you ever experienced a time and kind of separately, have you ever experienced a time when you felt like the world was ending? It will go to Matthew first. Oh, yeah. Every day. My anxiety tells me the world is ending every day. Okay. Why do you feel that way? Because like, I don't know, any small inconvenience kind of just like spirals. You know, okay. Can you give us an example? Oh, I woke up today. I chose wrong pair of socks. I didn't feel like the socks. And you just spiraled into me thinking that bad pair of socks, I was on the trip, I was on the fall, and I was on the die. Okay. But you're still alive, which is great, despite wearing that sock. We all know that, yeah. You're alive right now. It's got a solid, we live in the present. Right now we're left. Okay, we're living in the present. Okay. Alright, and how about you, Lily? Have you ever felt like the world was ending? The world? Maybe the world. But the, I mean, in the current political escape of the US, yes. Okay. Or like with climate change and everything, that's a constant anxiety that lives in my mind. Okay, could you talk about both of those separately? What, what worries you or what feels indicative of the end of the world as it relates to the political sphere in the US? I think in the, since the recent election, there has been a lot of societal separation. And we, I think, obviously my world is centered around the US because I've always lived in the US, I'm from the US. True. And I, it feels like the whole country is splitting apart. And to me, that feels like the, as the US is one of the top countries splits apart, then that's like indicative of the rest of the world, like starting to drag away from us. Okay. And then we're isolating ourselves and then it's all just kind of doomed to fall apart. Okay, got it. And you said that to some rise. Excuse me. And I wanted to kind of probe more into the, the US be one of the top countries. What makes you think that it's, or feel that it's one of the top countries? Well, just economically and military wise. Okay. Okay, in terms of numbers, in terms of influence. Both. I, yeah, because like don't we have the biggest navy in the world? Or I'm Canadian, I have no idea. It could be. I mean, I could be speaking into all the propaganda. I don't know. So you think there's a lot of propaganda right now, which you say? Oh, yeah. Okay. I think, I mean, the US, especially with the whole, people, people say a lot that this is like the greatest country on earth. Right. And like a lot of nationalism. And I, I think automatically that gets into our media because it's people, the media always looks for extreme views. So they always, we're looking at a lot of perspectives about how the US is better than everyone. And we can control whatever we want if we put our mind to it and get together as a society. I see. And then on the second part that you mentioned around climate, what do you feel around climate change right now or the climate crisis, those indicative of the end of the world? For the apocalypse specifically, the first thing that I think of is the timer in New York, where the climate. The climate? Yeah. And how it's just going, it's already been cut down. It used to be seven years. I think a couple of years ago, but now it's like four or something. Yes, yes. And that is horrifying to me, especially I also, my sister wanted to be an environmental, she's an environmental science major in college. So I've heard a lot from her about her perspective on just, she's also kind of a doom. She has a doom mindset. What does a doom mindset that the world, that the world is ending? I mean, that everything is doomed and there's no reason to fight for it or hope for better. And she's setting environmental science here. Yeah, kind of. And climate change specifically, it just feels like the more, and like I just saw today that Trump took away protections on endangered species, and there are plenty of national parks that have been funded and just, I see a different news headline article every day. And it's just, it feels like it's compounding in on me. Okay. How do you feel about the media's role in the apocalypse? I think you keep mentioning the news. Yeah, I mean, yeah, because the media, I mean the media is what I feed into every day. I look at social media, I look at the news, I look at like New York Times. And I think that's what's fueling people, like my sister's mindset, like the doom mindset that everything is going to fall apart because it's... Again, they look for those extreme views and they, they extremists usually feel like everything should be one way, like everything should be defunded and there's no reason to protect the national parks. Or the national parks are the most vital thing to society and if they aren't protected then we're all going to die. Yeah, I just think the media, the media controls society's opinion or the major public's opinion because that's how we communicate with each other. Right. Yeah. Okay, well thanks for sharing with us. Yeah. And I wanted to ask, I guess one last question here, if you could put a date on the end of the world or a number of years or months or whatever that would be, what would that be? I might ask Matthew you first. I don't say tomorrow. I don't say tomorrow. Like, I saw the like 10, 15 years from now I would say, okay, I don't think you guys know. How about you? Okay, I wouldn't say that soon. I don't, I don't, I like to have hope, I want to be an optimist. Okay. Because as much as it feels like the world is ending, it's really just my world and it's, it can be changed. It's very early. So if I had to put a date, I would say, well how would you define the world ending? My world, the world, the earth, I think it's the world as we know it is how we like to define the apocalypse. Like civilization, like, yeah, yeah, let's go with civilization. I'd say 200 years. So engineers. All right. Any other questions on us? No, I think that's it. Thank you so much for both of you. Thank you. Great.
