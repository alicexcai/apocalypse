 Hi everyone, I'm Numerah. I'm here with Jack Tien who is a senior at Harvard. And what are you studying? I'm doing a double between CS and psych. Okay, computer science and psychology. Yeah, computer science and psychology. Great, we're here today, Alice and I, my dear friend and classmate. We're here today asking people about their thoughts on the apocalypse. And I will first ask where are you from? I'm from California, so-called. Okay, why did you hesitate? Well, I lived there for four years, so I went to high school there and then before that, I moved all over the US. All over the US, okay. What would you call home? Say so-cal, yes. I mean, that's where my house is. But not Boston. No, definitely not. Even though you've been here for four years. No, I hate Boston. Hey, okay, so it's less about where you spend the most time more about your- It's where my heart lies. Your heart lies in so-cal. Yeah, my heart lies in so- Jack's heart lies in so-cal. Great. Do you think that we're in apocalypse right now? I would say that like- You could define it and- You could say so, yeah, you could say so. But would you say so? Would I say so? I would not say so. No. But why do you say that you could say so? Who could say so? Why? I mean, I think it's- Apocalypse is like the destruction of one's world. And then I think different people- World is like a very big term. I think different people kind of define world in different ways. And then- Yeah, I mean like- I think for me personally, yeah, like I'm fine. So you don't think that you're in an apocalypse? No, I don't think so. Have you ever had a moment in life when you felt like the world was ending? The world was ending now. Unless like that asteroid like hits Earth or whatever. But sorry, have you ever felt- Had a moment in life where you felt- Where I felt like- Yeah. The world was ending. I think I've felt moments of very intense sadness and- Maybe hopelessness, but I think hopeless- Like intense hopelessness is separate from like an apocalypse. How is it so? I think an apocalypse is like- Got it. Is, uh, hmm. I would say that like an apocalypse typically is like a destruction of something- in order for something to arise, right? Hopelessness is just like- Uh, it could be like a destruction of your- I don't really know how to put this into words, but it's like a destruction of your- It could be like a destruction of your inner light, but then that's like- That's kind of like- I don't know if anything else will like arise from that- So you think that in order for an apocalypse to occur, there has to be something that happens after it? That defines- Like an apocalypse is not defined just by the destructive event, but also- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think something has to- Not well, I don't- I think like something happening after it is like a- a vague term. I think it's like- Um- I think it includes both the before and the after. Like it's not like something happens, it's just like something- Like there's- it's there, it like exists- Okay. After- Interesting. Um, when do you think the world's going to end? Um, I think like scientifically like- I think isn't like the sun's supposed to like slow the earth in like a few billion years? Or like I think the- the most- Well I think there's like- Is it there like a few like hypotheses? Like I think like- It's like either like human- I think you think the world is going to end. For me personally it's like when I die right? Because I won't- Like my world is just my consciousness and how I perceive things. Like when I die like the world ends for me right? Okay, okay. So you don't think that your consciousness will live on? No, no, no, I don't think so. It'll die with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are there any leads? Do you- can you remember your past consciousness? Yeah, I don't look at you. I don't know if I can talk about that during this interview. Um, okay, so you- You think that the world ends when you are world ends with your consciousness? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think my personal world- How about planet Earth? Planet Earth, yeah like I said, like, nookin, nookin there. Like, uh- Like the physical rock is like- Well, I make you a destroy by like the sun or whatever, but I think like- It depends on also how you define the planet. Is it like- Uh- Planet Earth? I know, like- are you defining it by like, oh, as long as there's life on planet Earth? Oh, yeah, so it's actually a human civilization. Human civilization? Then I mean, it can end a lot of different ways, right? It's like, AI takes over blah blah, we all like die. Okay, if AI were to take over, what- what day would you put on it? Oh, like, like 10 years maybe? 10 years from now, okay, interesting. What- and you said like, AI take over and one thing, nukes or another thing? Yeah, I mean, yeah. I mean, there's like a million like possibilities. What are the million? Can you name five? You just name five? Okay, I- AI. Asteroid? What would that be? We don't really know. I mean, that could happen whenever. Whatever, okay. Three. Uh- Aliens in the Earth. What would that happen? Uh, I don't know, like, also whenever. Okay. Um, uh, a global pandemic, some crazy pandemic. Okay, did that- Actually, I don't know, I don't know if a pandemic is actually possible. It's- I think like that- Like, actually it probably is, but like, I feel like it's very unlikely. Um, I don't know, I don't know if I could name another one. What's for? Okay, okay, that's great. Um, give me the other questions, Alice. I try to- Oh, I have one, I have one. So we talk about- There's a lot to talk right now about World War III. Oh, okay. And what that war is- Is- What's going to spark that war? What do you think will be the crux or the theme of World War III? I think World War III is actually very unlikely. Like, I think one thing- I feel like people always like, uh, say nuclear weapons are a bad thing, but Loki, I think- Uh, World War III- In my opinion, it's going to be kind of unlikely between major nuclearized superpowers, because like everyone's kind of afraid of that. So you think that World War III is going to be around nuclear weapons? I think it's just unlikely to ever happen. If it- And if it does happen, it will- Uh, I think it's honestly just unlikely to happen. But if there was a World War III, what do you think that there would be around? What would the- I think it would just be like some issue of human pride, honestly, because I think- Um, I think like- If you're rationally thinking, no one ever actually wants to end the world. And so no one's going to be launching nukes for like some like fossil fuel or some shit like that. Like I think it's mostly just going to be like- Some like- Some crazy person like- Like, oh my god, like my ego is so hurt, so hurt. Let me like launch like some nukes at them. Like- Okay, so you think that World War III will be the product of some persons ego? Yeah, I mean, that's the same way World War I will start it right now. Wasn't that like friends, Ferdinand, whatever, whatever, things? I don't even remember, but yeah. Okay, great. Any other questions? No. Thank you so much, yeah. Great.
