 Let me see this. Hi, I'm Nimira. Nice to meet you. What are your names? Jiva. Kavira and... Jiva. Jiva. J-I-V-A Jiva, thank you. J-I-V-A. Got it. How are you both doing today? Good. Good. How old are you? I'm four. You're four? Four and a half. You're four and a half? Okay. And you're eight? Okay. I'm 21 and three quarters. Do you think that's really old? Not really. What do you think is really old? Like... 260? Like 260? How about you? Like a thousand. Like a thousand. That's really old. Okay. Interesting. Well, Alice and I, this is my friend Alice here. We are taking a class at Harbrood that is about the end of the world. Have you ever thought about the end of the world before? Sometimes. Sometimes? What do you think about the end of the world? I don't know. Like when I say the end of the world, what does that look like to you? I'm scared. Scary? What is scary about it? Like if the end of the world was right now, what would it look like in this area? It would be like dark. It would be dark? Okay. Yeah. I think it would be dark. Anything else you think? Like what there would be... It would be sunny and hot. You think it's gonna be sunny and hot? Like really hot? Yeah. It's really, really hot. Like really, really hot? Like a fire or something? Yeah. Okay. Interesting. When do you think the end of the world is gonna be here? I don't know. The lens of years from now? Billions of years from now. Okay. Chiefa, what do you think? It's 100 years from now. 800 years from now. These are pretty different numbers. Billions is a lot bigger than 800. Yeah. But you don't think it's gonna be tomorrow? No. No. You don't think it's gonna be in 10 years? No. No. No. So you don't think... Did you hear about the big fires in California? Did you hear about those? Yeah. They're like these big, big fires in forest in California. Does that feel like the end of the world? Or no, that's pretty normal? They're kind of normal. Kind of normal? Yeah? You look like you're deep in thought. Come here. I think so a lot. What do you think about that? Do you think about climate change? Do you think about climate change? Do you think about climate change? Yeah. What? Can you tell me about climate changes? It's flood. The worms of the earth. Okay. Did you say flood? What did you say? It's flood, yeah. It's flood. Yeah, that's true. Climate change is a lot of different things that happen with the weather. It's like fires, it's floods. And all the sudden, it's sunny. And all the sudden, sometimes it's too hot. And sometimes it's too hot. Well, you were just saying that the end of the world could be when it gets really, really hot, right? Yeah. But climate scientists are saying that that could be within 50 years or even less than 100 years. But you think it's still going to be way off into the future or do you think it could come soon? Yeah. Way off into the future. Okay, so you don't think that the end of the world is anywhere nearby. No. No. No, you don't think so. Do you ever feel worried about what's happening to the world or sometimes what do you worry about? Are you worried about the government? Are you worried about climate? Are you worried about friendship with other people? Are you worried about climate? Climate. Climate. Okay. Climate. Yeah, is there anything else that worries you in life? Not really? Hello. No. I kind of jealous. I feel like I have a bunch of worries in life. I'm worried. Are you worried about school or no? No. No. Are you worried about your friendships with other people? No. No. Are you worried about your stick here? No. Not really. You two are kind of just chilling, huh? Yeah. What? It's kind of hot. It's kind of hot? Yeah, kind of warm. It is pretty warm. But it doesn't feel like the end of the world warm. That would be really hot. Yeah, that would be really hot. So right now the temperature is what is in Fahrenheit? It's like 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah. So it feels the end of the world how hot do you think it would be? 185. 185. 185. 185. 185. 185. Okay, okay. That's like an oven. 1000. 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. Like as hot as a clay kiln. As hot as a clay kiln. Yeah. Okay, interesting. Yeah. I don't know if any question? How would you survive it? That's a good question. Yeah, if the end of the world was coming, and you know, we see on TV the end of the world is here, your teachers are saying it. How do you think you would survive? How do you get through the end of the world? What would you do if it gets really hot? What do you do? I think I knew. Yeah. You get a fan? Yeah. But if it's 185 degrees Fahrenheit, a fan's not going to help you. I need a gigantic fan. You need a gigantic fan. Would you build it? Would you buy it? How? How? That's going to be bigger than anything. Yeah, it's going to be bigger than anything. That's true. So how would you survive if it gets super, super hot if it's the end of the world? What do you do? I just have to make it into the end of the world. You don't know? How about you, Cabeer? I don't know. You don't know how you survive it? What does your mom say? I don't think we can survive it. I don't think we can survive it. I don't think we can survive it. Oh no. I don't think we can survive it. We have to find big fans. We have to make big fans. Huh? Right? How? Maybe Alice can make a big fan. Yeah. Any other questions, Alice? Okay. Do you have any advice on how to survive it? I also have a hand fan that works even when it's really hot. Okay, so it has to be a hand fan that works even when it's really hot. So the batteries can't explode. Somehow. Somehow. Okay, well, we are counting on you as the next...
