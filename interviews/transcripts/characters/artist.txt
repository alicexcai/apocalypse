 Okay, hi, I'm Numerah and we're here today with Morana Tupal. And we're asking Morana to different questions about how he feels around the apocalypse. And how old are you? What do you study? What do you do here? I'm 21. I study English and theater dance and media and I write and direct theater, write and direct film, I also produce as well. Okay, great. And where are you from? New Jersey. New Jersey. And how long have you? What year are you in at Harvard? A second year. Second year. Okay, and so you have a couple of years left at Harvard. Great. And my first question to you is, have you ever felt like there's a time when the world, the world felt like it was ending? And it could be on a personal level, it could be on a global level, whatever you think. Oh, interesting. Like metaphorically or like literally? In any way. In the context. Okay, okay, okay. I would say I thought the world was ending like the end of my spring semester my first year. I felt like the world was ending only because of the fact we're like, what's it called? In terms of the amount of work that I had to do and the amount of projects that was working on, I felt like none of it all couldn't get done and I thought it was open for me afterward. Okay, so felt instrumentsable. Precisely. Yeah, exactly. Any other feelings around that experience? Ah, like there was no way out that like it was going to eat me alive. Like there was no version of this of which I could complete everything to the best of my degree and come out of it like saying. Okay, well you got out of it. Did you come out saying? I did. I think I came out a little less saying than I thought, but like still saying, which is good. Okay, you know? Okay, got it. We often talk about in terms of apocalypse, you often talk about a sort of re-birth transformation that occurs at bells, that occurs after an apocalypse. Do you think that you experienced something like this with this time at the end of your first year? Oh, most definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Do you tell someone about that? Definitely. Yeah. Um, I realized that I'm not infallible as a human being. I realized that I do have faults and there is such a thing as too much for someone like me. And so I realized my limits are the things that I could do and understood, okay, cool. Now I have to like take things a little slower. And I understand like how much I'm capable of, which is which is good, honestly. I think the best people in the best artists know how much they're able to do and like delegate the rest to other people. Okay. How do you separate your identity as a human being if we identity as an artist? Oof. Um, that's difficult because like I feel like my identity is an artist. But I guess like I try to are unsure to like not have all of my friends like be friends who are in the art. So I'm not like like as much as I do love talking about all the time. I want to make sure that like the friends that I have also are friends in like different areas of study. So I'm not like talking with the same things over and over again. And I'm exposing myself to different things as well. And the classes that I choose what I always try and like every so often pick a class that's like not art related just so I can expose myself to other things and such. What is that class for you this semester? This semester? Um, I can't lie to you. I dropped that class. Um, which is which is which is down on my end. It was it was a prediction, Jen. But next semester though, that is going to be uh I'm going to need to be learning a language. So that's good. What language is that going to be? Haitian Creole. Haitian Creole. Okay, great. And then I also want to ask do you think the apocalypse is coming? Um, I think it's always coming. Okay. Always. We're always like a few days or a few something away from an apocalypse. What is something are we away from it right now? As in if you could put an approximate date on it and that could be days away, it could be a day, it could be years. That's a good question. Answer the question. I think, okay, I guess cool. I'm making about art. I think we're reaching like in our a death of our artistic apocalypse. I can pretty confidently say like five years. Five years. Probably. Okay, five years from now we will hit an artistic apocalypse. Yeah, I hate to say it. Great. Any other questions, Alice? Well, I want to hear more about the artistic. Yes, tell us more about the artistic. What does this entail? What does it look like? Is there? Gladly. So I think, okay, so the film industry, this is our industry, I'd be like, I'll speak specifically for film. Ghost Through Faces of which that like where there be times where we have a lot of indie filmmakers breaking into the scene and we're seeing a lot of like fresh new takes on much different films, a lot of avant-garde stuff. And then oh, like probably like golden age of Hollywood, like we're talking like 20s to like, sorry, not like 50, 60s, like that's like golden age. And then we're and then after that period we shift into like more studio based films. We're like a bunch of big studios are like making a lot of commercial films with a lot of like big time actors, yada yada yada. And like the film industry oscillates between these two things from time to time. Right now we're in much more of like a big studio like moment right now. But the difference between now and before is that now we have AI. And AI is going to keep us there essentially because now we're we see in a bad way because now what's happening is that like instead of like hiring extras we just AI people in. Instead of like hiring like voice actors to come and do voice work all we need to do is get your voice for like for a for a snippet. That's what we do right now. Exactly. Use AI to like like take the voice and they can put it wherever they want to and actor can just stay home. Okay. All they have to do is give their likeness to a studio and they can do everything and I can just stay home and do nothing about it. Um, not to mention it like massive studios are like buying up everything and it's going to get to a certain point where like there's five studios and there's four. There's three there's two then there's one and of course you exactly. And so we're going to see this start seeing very similar films of like the same genre and everything. And the indie filmmakers can't break through anymore because this this the one company will be so overbearing that like there's just like to be able to find an indie film you have to literally go out of your way because there's going to be no way for you to actually like see or do it. So so correct me if I'm wrong but but a sort of indication that we've hit the statistic apocalypse will be a monopolization of definitely a bee um audiences feeling a lot more comfortable with the type of films that those studios are making because of audiences are final with it then the studios aren't going to change. Oh cool people are eating us so we're going to keep making more and also an acceptance of like AI in the industry as well. If people are becoming much more like accepting of it then students are like cool that we can like fire a bunch of these people and just use AI for it instead which takes us out of the job. Right. And so and I don't also this is the whole set of argument but like I don't AI can't create art like the interesting. It cannot make art there's no way there's no way um but yeah awesome any other questions I think we're good thank you so much for your time we appreciate it. Of course of course
