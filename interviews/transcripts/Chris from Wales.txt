 Great, perfect. We're looking here. Yes, we're looking over here. You can look wherever you'd like. I'm Namiara. Nice to meet you. What's your name? Chris. Good to meet you. Chris. I'm with Chris here in the middle of Harvard yard. And Alice is my classmate and dear friend here. We're in a class semester called Stories from the end of the world. Excuse me. It's on the apocalypse, on the end of the world. Optimistic. And you think, are you optimistic? No, it's not an optimistic topic. Okay. This is true. Especially for us, we're also seniors. We're in our last semester of studying. There's a lot going on in the world right now. So we thought we'd ask strangers around campus what their thoughts are in the end of the world. And would you mind us asking just a little bit about yourself, what do you do? What do you find interesting? My name is Chris. I'm from the UK and from Wales originally. Okay. I'm a director of sport in the UK. Okay. And over here to learn about the sport and program at Harvard. Okay. So director of sport in Wales? No, just outside London. Absolutely. And for a school, is it? High school, yeah. For a high school, yeah. Yeah. And so you're here to learn about what it looks like at Harvard for. Yeah. Essentially, yeah. Okay. Super. And what do you think about Harvard so far? Pretty amazing. Is it your first time here? This is my first time in Harvard. Yeah, not the first time in Boston, because I'm Harvard. Yeah, it's amazing. Building is beautiful. Right. The weather is nice too. I think you got kind of lucky because we have not had the best weather in the past few. No, I've been here for a week. It's been terrible. Okay. Well, I can imagine. Well, great that you're here now and it's sunny. And my first question to you is, have you ever experienced a moment in time or a period in time when you felt like the world was ending? Oh my goodness. You might make me cry here now. Have I felt when the world was going to end? Yeah, when I was very young, I worked at McDonald's. Okay. And I got fired. And I thought that was the end of the world. I was like 16, you know, as a student. Yeah, that was traumatic. But I learned an important lesson. Could we ask why you got fired? Basically, the person who came in, come to me, I'm sharing this story. Thank you for bringing that with you. It's okay. It's okay. The person who came in to order the food ordered like one big Mac. And I, subsequently, he was a friend of mine and I gave him 10 big Macs. Okay. So yeah, I got fired. You got fired. All right. Well, we often talk about, in the context of apocalypse, the sort of rebirth or transformation that happens after the apocalypse. Do you think that you experience this after you felt like it was the end of the world? Was there any sort of transformation that you experienced? Yeah, it was a really important life lesson to kind of try and play by the rules and to be accountable for your actions. So yeah, it was a really seminal kind of lesson at a kind of important time in my life. Okay, interesting. But I guess there are different parts of that too because you were a good friend to that friend. I'm sure they really enjoyed the big Macs. True. But it was like a way of a good friend. The problem was he actually worked there as well. So he got sacked as well. Without actually doing anything. Right. Okay. This is a deep story. It's a great story. We've heard a wide, re-entered story that are in through the past few days. Yeah. The next question I have for you is, when do you think the apocalypse is coming? And this could be a date. It could be a number of years. It could be months. It could be anything. Can be any type of apocalypse. Define apocalypse. The end of the world. The end of the world. Right. But what others? I don't think that's coming. I think the world will be here. Okay. Yeah. I'm not a big apocalypse guy. The end of the world. The end of the world. The end of the world as we know it. It's changing minute by minute, hour by hour. Right. I mean, since you man put the tariffs on that, the world looks pretty different after that. Okay. So you think tariffs are what's edging us towards the apocalypse? No, I don't. But I think that I am my point being the world looks different every day. Every day. Okay. What do you think will be the next big thing after something like tariffs? What do I think will be the next big thing after? Big thing as in leading us to the end of the world as we know it. Okay. Your friend has said something here. The rugby world. Cup coming to America. Yeah. No, I was thinking. What maybe Wales win in a rugby match? I'm a passionate Welsh supporter. We haven't won in a long time. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. I'm not sure. Probably some war out of my mind. Some war. Okay. If there was a World War III, people talk about this all the time nowadays. And there are questions about what would this world war be around? What do you think that the next world war might be? Well, it's normally about land or religion. Right. Isn't it probably? Probably. I actually think I would go resources in roles. Okay. Resources of some kind. Okay. So minerals as the one that you're going to see there. Okay. Great. Any other questions, Alice? Okay. I think that's everything. Thank you very much Chris. Really appreciate your time.
